# **Context**

Chatters, a website where you can chat with other people about anything and everything. It is a community platform in the form of a blog where users can
interact with other users posts and share their opinions. Users can create an account where they can edit their profile image, their bio and other
settings.

## **Strategy**

<span id="ux-strategy"></span>

### **Site Aims**

My main aim for the website was to let user to be able to save their posts for future reference as well as interacting with other users. I wanted to create a community where people can quickly access any type of topics they are interested in be it gaming or world news.

The website needs to let user to:

- Sort posts to their needs.
- Create and set up their account.
- Create posts with either published or draft status.
- Upvote or downvote each post.

### **Opportunities**

With the user stories in mind, I have made a table below to narrow down and prioritize the scope of intended strategy.
